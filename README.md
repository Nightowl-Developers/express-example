# express-example
A simple and well thought out express.js backend server.

## Motivation

Express example is a working prototype for @Nightowl-Developers/generator-nightowl-express. It is a simple testbed application that allows me to make 
development and infrastructure decisions that I feel comfortable with in a production environment.

2. Install dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

3. Start nodemon

```shell
npm run build

4. Run the app

```
